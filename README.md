# RYCHAPIClient

[![Travis CI Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/ryuichis/RYCHAPIClient.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ryuichis/RYCHAPIClient)

RYCHAPIClient is a lightweight HTTP networking library written in Swift.

It's highly inspired by [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) and [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya).
Basically, I have been using both awesome libraries since Swift released, and I loved them.
However, two feelings built up gradually:

- [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it):
  No matter working on clients' work or my own projects,
  I feel they are heavy for the most of my projects.

- Waiting for catching up with Swift changes:
  Swift changes very frequently (especially Swift 3),
  but I couldn't delay my daily work and wait for them to catch up.

So, I decided to write my own. Very simple and very lightweight.
I wrote the initial code in early 2015.
So far, it has been adopted in several projects.
At least, I am confident to open source this small library,
just in case it could also help others.
